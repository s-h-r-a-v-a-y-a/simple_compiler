# simple_compiler
This repository contains a simple compiler for educational purposes. It includes a lexical analyzer (lexer), parser, semantic analysis, and basic code generation. Built with Python and PLY, it supports a subset of programming constructs like variables, operators, and conditionals. Contributions are welcome!
